- **Health monitoring** endpoint
- **Development and production configurations**

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Enterprise Design Patterns**
- **SOLID principles** throughout the codebase
- **Factory pattern** for agent creation
- **Strategy pattern** for model routing
- **Observer pattern** for event handling
- **Command pattern** for workflow execution

### **Korea-Specific Optimizations**
- **Region-locked routing** to ap-northeast-2
- **Cost optimization strategy** prioritizing Claude 3 Haiku
- **Latency minimization** with regional model selection
- **Budget controls** with daily/monthly limits

### **Scalability & Performance**
- **Connection pooling** for MongoDB (10 max, 2 min)
- **Compression enabled** (snappy, zlib)
- **Intelligent caching** with TTL management
- **Parallel execution** capabilities with concurrency control

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### **Dependencies Management**
```json
{
  "core": ["@nestjs/core", "@nestjs/common", "@nestjs/config"],
  "database": ["@nestjs/mongoose", "mongoose"],
  "ai": ["@aws-sdk/client-bedrock", "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime"],
  "security": ["@nestjs/throttler"],
  "documentation": ["@nestjs/swagger"],
  "monitoring": ["@nestjs/event-emitter"]
}
```

### **API Endpoints Structure**
```
/api/
├── canvas/              # Core image generation
│   ├── generate         # Create images
│   ├── search/similar   # Semantic search
│   ├── public          # Public gallery
│   └── analytics       # Usage insights
├── demo/posts/          # Demo features (REMOVABLE)
│   ├── create          # Social post creation
│   ├── trending        # Trending posts
│   └── admin/cleanup   # Demo removal
└── docs                # Swagger documentation
```

### **Database Schema Design**
- **canvas_content**: Image metadata, embeddings, analytics
- **plugins**: Plugin registry with configuration
- **workflow_executions**: Complete execution tracking
- **model_usage**: Cost and performance analytics
- **demo_posts**: Isolated demo data (easily removable)

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### **Production Considerations**
- **Environment configuration** with secure defaults
- **Error handling** with comprehensive logging
- **Rate limiting** (100 requests/minute)
- **Health monitoring** with uptime tracking
- **Cost monitoring** with alert thresholds

### **Security Features**
- **Input validation** with whitelisting
- **CORS configuration** with origin control
- **Bearer token authentication** ready
- **Request throttling** protection
- **Secret management** via environment variables

## 🧪 Demo Removal Strategy

### **Complete Separation Achieved**
- ✅ **Database isolation**: Demo data in separate collections
- ✅ **API isolation**: Demo endpoints under `/api/demo/*`
- ✅ **Module isolation**: `DemoPostCreationModule` is independent
- ✅ **Dependency direction**: Demo depends on Canvas, not vice versa

### **Removal Process**
1. **Data cleanup**: `DELETE /api/demo/posts/admin/cleanup-all`
2. **Module removal**: Remove import from `app.module.ts`
3. **File deletion**: Delete `/src/plugins/demo-post-creation/`
4. **Verification**: Core Canvas functionality remains 100% intact

## 📈 Business Impact
